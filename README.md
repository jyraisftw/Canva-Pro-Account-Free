# Canva Pro Account Free – How to Access Premium Features Without a Subscription
While Canva Pro itself is a paid service, there are limited ways to access some Pro features for free. By signing up for Canva’s 30-day Pro trial, users can enjoy premium tools like the background remover and premium photos without any initial cost. Educators and students may also access Canva Pro’s full suite of features through the Canva for Education program, which provides a free Pro account to verified educational institutions. Once registered, users can enjoy the enhanced design tools that Canva Pro offers, enabling them to create professional-quality projects without a paid subscription.
